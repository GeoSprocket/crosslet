crosslet
========

**Crosslet** is a small javascript widget for interactive visualisation and analysis of geostatistical datasets, e.g. GDP per country, election results for each region of the country, etc. You can also use it for comparing multiple features.

It is a combination of three very powerfull javascript libraries:
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), an elegant and beautiful mapping solution, and
* [Crossfilter](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/), a library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser.
* [D3](http://d3js.org/), used for manipulating documents based on data.

See [Crosslet page](http://sztanko.github.com/crosslet/) for documentation and examples.
